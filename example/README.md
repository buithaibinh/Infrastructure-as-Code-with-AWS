```

**Update serverless.yml**

**Update auth.json**

Open file `configs/auth.json` and update `FacebookClientId, FacebookClientSecret, GoogleClientId, GoogleClientSecret` which created above.

```
{
  "hostedUIProviderCreds": "[{\"ProviderName\":\"Facebook\",\"client_id\":\"FacebookClientId\",\"client_secret\":\"FacebookClientSecret\"},{\"ProviderName\":\"Google\",\"client_id\":\"GoogleClientId\",\"client_secret\":\"GoogleClientSecret\"}]",
  "hostedUIProviderMeta": "[{\"ProviderName\":\"Facebook\",\"authorize_scopes\":\"email,public_profile\",\"AttributeMapping\":{\"email\":\"email\",\"username\":\"id\",\"name\":\"name\",\"picture\":\"cover\"}},{\"ProviderName\":\"Google\",\"authorize_scopes\":\"openid email profile\",\"AttributeMapping\":{\"email\":\"email\",\"username\":\"sub\",\"name\":\"name\",\"picture\":\"picture\"}}]"
}
```

**Push notification Setup**

1. Create 2 platform applications. 1 for FCM, 1 for APN follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-mobile-application-as-subscriber.html).
2. Update `configs/push.json` with 2 platform applications which created above
```
{
  "applicationTopic": "${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-App",
  "FCM_APP_ARN": "MY_FCM_APP_ARN",
  "APN_APP_ARN": "MY_APN_APP_ARN"
}
```

**Deploy back-end service**

```
serverless deploy -v
```
After deploy successful, a config file will be created at `output/aws-exports.json`. Use this file for configuring at the front-end side. Beside that, all information is written to stdout

## frontend_vuejs

Web application using VueJS framework and amplify-js library for play with AWS service.

**Checkout**

```sh
# Create a new project
svn export https://github.com/skglobal-jsc/Infrastructure-as-Code-with-AWS/trunk/exmple/frontend_vuejs your-project-name
# Change into the newly created directory
cd your-project-name
```

**Configuration**

After successfully deploy backend_nodejs, please download `aws-exports.js`, `schema.graphql`, `app-sync.js` and replace with existing files in the project. These files contain keys and project identity for using AWS service.

**Deploy**

```sh
# Run frontend_vuejs
npm i | yarn install
# Start the dev server
npm run dev | yarn dev
```

## mobile_flutter

Mobile application using cross platform Mobile framework - Flutter. Currently AWD Amplify library have not supported for Flutter yet but we worked around with a little tweak from [unofficial amplify for dart](https://github.com/skglobal-jsc/amazon-cognito-identity-dart-with-sns-sign-in).

```sh
# Create a new project
svn export https://github.com/skglobal-jsc/Infrastructure-as-Code-with-AWS/trunk/exmple/mobile_flutter your-project-name
# Change into the newly created directory
cd your-project-name
```

**Configuration**

Again, please use information in `aws-exports.js` file get from server to replace into `lib/entries/secret.dart` file.

**Deploy**

```sh
# Run mobile_flutter
flutter run
```
